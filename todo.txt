#TODO:

- requestLogic File Lines 76-116: find a better and more accurate way to find and return the integer.
 we may have to write a scrubbing function or something because a comma will throw the whole thing off. 
 sometimes doesn't even return the correct thing in terminal as string

- work on actual browse logic (lines 168+ in old.py)

- next GUI screens to browse abstracts and search around and stuff

- improve current browse GUI (cancel, more options, back to settings, etc)
